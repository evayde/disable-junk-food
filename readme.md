# #DisableJunkFood

## Challenge@HomeOffice

- no lunch break with colleagues
- only junk food every day
- no team events
- talking only about work on the telephone

## Solution@HomeOffice

- live cooking event with colleagues
- one member of the team chooses recipe
- 2-3 days in advance the member shares the recipe so you can organize the ingredients
- one member shows how to cook the meal
- everybody should activate their video
- all members cook together and interact

## Eating@HomeOffice

- after cooking you can have a virtual lunch break together
- you have time to talk about something different than work
- eating in groups with a maximum of 5 people might be useful

## How it Works

- First install dependencies `npm i`
- To run the server: `npm run dev`
- The client is currently seperate and can be run with `npm start`
- The main idea was to connect the client later with the express server
- We wanted that a colleage can host a live cooking session and share it to his colleagues
  - You can share the current recipe that you are cooking using the ChefKoch API or other cooking apis
  - Use WebRTC to host a video-stream with voice chat or alternatively implement a connection to Zoom etc.
  - Cook for your colleagues / and have a conversation
  - Eat together and have fun@Work!

## Have fun cooking and eating together!
