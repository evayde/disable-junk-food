# #DisableJunkFood

## Challenge@HomeOffice
- no lunch break with colleagues
- only junk food every day
- no team events
- talking only about work on the telephone

## Solution@HomeOffice
- live cooking event with colleagues
- one member of the team chooses recipe
- 2-3 days in advance the member shares the recipe so you can organize the ingredients
- one member shows how to cook the meal
- everybody should activate their video
- all members cook together and interact

## Eating@HomeOffice
-after cooking you can have a virtual lunch break together
-you have time to talk about something different than work
-eating in groups with a maximum of 5 people might be useful

## Have fun cooking and eating together!
